This is a journey into creating a community to build an open-source project that will be useful to developers in the coming times.  
  
For this project, we will use the Django rest framework to build the API with the help of other great libraries to ensure we have a robust project.  
  
We hope to continue to talk about the journey from now till infinity and that the experience will enlighten us and inform you in the long run
